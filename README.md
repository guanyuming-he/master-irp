# What is this README About
Since all important background, methodology, results, and discussion can be
found in the main thesis (gh124-final-report.pdf), the README is ONLY concerned
with how to setup and build the project, with the requirements.

## Setup the $\LaTeX$ compilation
To compile my thesis (final report), project plan, presentation slides, one
must ensure she has a working environment where `latexmk` can run, and all the
necessary packages are installed.

I personally use the TeXLive distribution, but any other distribution with
sufficient packages should work as well.

## Setup the Python environment
For easy management of packages, I use Anaconda distribution for Python. 
To record all my installed packages, I exported them via the following
commands:
```
conda env export --from-history >./python-env/environment.yml
python3 -m pip freeze >./python-env/requirements.txt
```

One has to install all the packages listed in the two files to make my Python
scripts work on one's computer.

Note that I use Python version 3.11, not the latest, to be compatible with
ollama and open-webui.

## Setup the environment to compile C++ programs
Setting up C++ programs is the hardest among all, because there's no concept as
a package in C++, and libraries are managed and installed in different ways.

However, there's a handy list of all the libraries that are needed, just inside
my `CMakeLists.txt`. I believe it describes where I expect there libraries to
be put in the system. In particular, because I only use Python from the
Anaconda env, I link to the CPython library there from my C++ programs, not to
the system's CPython Library. One must modify where one's Anaconda path is
inside the CMakeLists.txt to ensure that it's the correct path.

As for the C++ compiler, one must use a compiler that supports most of C++ 20.
Personally, I use `g++ (Debian 12.2.0-14+deb12u1) 12.2.0`.

## Other requirements
One should also install `ollama` and the models one wants to use (by default,
it's those inside the default `config.json`, which is generated by the pipeline
for the first time; one can also look into `config.py` to check the models).

To run these modells smoothly in one's local computer, one should have
recommended at least 16GiB RAM and a GPU with at least 8GiB VRAM. It is
possible, indeed, to run such models without a dedicated GPU or less RAM, but
that would make the process much more slow.

One should have `cron` (which is by default installed on most GNU/Linux and
Unix-like OS), for the task schedulling feature to work.
