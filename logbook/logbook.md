## Meeting (06 June 2025)
*Present: Guanyuming He (GH, student), Sean O'Grady (SO, main supervisor),
Rhodri Nelson (RN, second supervisor)*

### Key points discussed:
I briefed them my literature review and very rough plan.

### Feedback received:
- They believed I could use less works for the background review.
- Sean thought my plan captures his requirements well.
- Rhodri thought my design is plausible, but it's important to get a prototype
  fist.

I will polish my plan before the deadline, and try to work on a prototype as
much as I can.
