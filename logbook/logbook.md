# Logbook

## Meeting (30 May 2025)
*Present: Guanyuming He (GH, student), Sean O'Grady (SO, main supervisor)*

### Key points discussed:
Sean briefed me on the project background, the initiative to develop a software
system, why the state-of-the-art systems are not enough, and his general
requirements for me.

### Feedback received:
None. It is the first meeting.

### Work plan before next meeting:
I will on a literature review of the background and current systems, and give
an initial and rough plan of it.

## Meeting (06 June 2025)
*Present: Guanyuming He (GH, student), Sean O'Grady (SO, main supervisor),
Rhodri Nelson (RN, second supervisor)*

### Key points discussed:
I briefed them my literature review and very rough plan.

### Feedback received:
- They believed I could use less works for the background review.
- Sean thought my plan captures his requirements well.
- Rhodri thought my design is plausible, but it's important to get a prototype
  fist.

### Work plan before next meeting:
I will polish my plan before the deadline, and try to work on a prototype as
much as I can.

## Meeting (13 June 2025)
*Present: Guanyuming He (GH, student), Sean O'Grady (SO, main supervisor)*

### Key points discussed:
I presented my finished project plan and a small LLM prototype that can for now
turn text into search engine prompts.

### Feedback received:
- He thought my plan was good.
- He thought the prompts were close to the text given, but he thought they were
  too academic. Need to direct the search engines towards real examples.

### Work plan before next meeting:
I will improve that part and also continue working on a custom search
component.

## Meeting (20 June 2025)
*Present: Guanyuming He (GH, student), Sean O'Grady (SO, main supervisor)*

### Key points discussed:
Sean let me know he could not attend the meeting, so I sent him a text message
containing my progress that week: building the scraping and parsing part of my
search engine.

I also sent a copy of it to Rhodri.

### Feedback received:
N/A

### Work plan before next meeting:
I will finish the search engine next week.

## Meeting (27 June 2025)
*Present: Guanyuming He (GH, student), Sean O'Grady (SO, main supervisor)*

### Key points discussed:
I basically finishes the main functions of the search engine, and presented it
the Sean. For queries regarding objects, e.g. Donald Trump, tariffs, it worked
well. However, it didn't work well when given questions or indirect sentences.
The LLM also didin't work well to transfer them into good seach engine prompts.

Another problem is that the database was highly imbalanced towards business
insider.

### Feedback received:
Sean said he would give me a few topics to feed into my tool, and asked me to
sent him the results, about which he would give feedbacks on. He also said he
would send them to Rhodri to request his comments on how to tune the LLM better
for that.

### Work plan before next meeting:
I will wait for his feed back on that, while try to balance the database of my
search engine.
